# Movie Recommendation System using Machine Learning in Python 

### About Movie Recommendation Project
In this machine learning project, we build a content-based recommendation engine from the ground up to suggest movies to the user based on their preferences. 

### Project Dataset
There are several datasets available to build a movie recommendation system, but for this project, we are going to use a dataset that contains the movie metadata (cast, crew, budget, etc..). The dataset can be downloaded here: [Movie Recommendation Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/tmdb/tmdb-movie-metadata) (Kaggle)

### Tools and Libraries used
* Python – 3.x
* Pandas – 1.2.4
* Scikit-learn – 0.24.1

#### This project idea and code is adapted from TechVidvan and it can be found [here](https://techvidvan.com/tutorials/movie-recommendation-system-python-machine-learning/). Most everything copied down exactly so that I could learn GitHub, Markdown, Machine Learning code, and also implement a bit of my own Python knowledge.
